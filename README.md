Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm Daquan, however, you may also call me Orbw33vr!

I'm an aspiring Front-End developer. 

This space is a place for me to showcase my skills.

My goal is to showcase the skills acquired and growth as a Front-End developer through several technologies to include:

*HTML5
*CSS3 + Bootstrap
*JavaScript + React.js and Node.js
*Git

Thank you for stopping by!

Please feel free to leave your feedback, tips and tricks in the comments! (Keeping the tone professional of course!)
